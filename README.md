A Behat Extension that makes use of [Wiremock](http://wiremock.org) as a test double for API calls.

## Versions and compatibility
* Versions 1.x are compatible with behat 2.4+
* No compatibility for behat 3 (yet...)
* No compatibility for Windows

## Installation
Via composer:
```json
"require-dev": {
    "creativesoftworks/behat-wiremock-context-extension": "1.*"
}
```
Your FeatureContext class must implement the [CreativeSoftworks\BehatWiremockContextExtension\WiremockContextAware](https://github.com/creativesoftworks/BehatWiremockContextExtension/blob/master/src/CreativeSoftworks/BehatWiremockContextExtension/WiremockContextAware.php) interface, here's an example:

```php
class FeatureContext implements WiremockContextAware
{
    /**
     * @return \CreativeSoftworks\BehatWiremockContextExtension\WiremockContext
     */
    public function getWiremockContext()
    {
        return $this->getSubcontext('WiremockContext');
    }

    /**
     * @param \CreativeSoftworks\BehatWiremockContextExtension\WiremockContext $wiremockContext
     */
    public function setWiremockContext(WiremockContext $wiremockContext)
    {
        $this->useContext('WiremockContext', $wiremockContext);
    }
}
```

## Configuration
Configuration options, in your behat.yml:
```yaml
your_profile_name:
    extensions:
        CreativeSoftworks\BehatWiremockContextExtension\Extension:
            wiremock_base_url: 'http://localhost:8080'
            wiremock_mappings_path: 'app/Resources/wiremock/mappings'
```

The extension will reset the wiremock mappings before each scenario execution, so all mappings under wiremock_mappings_path will get loaded with no guaranteed order.
Frequently you would want to guarantee that certain mappings will become defaults in wiremock (usually successful responses instead of failed ones).
In order for that to happen you can define an array of mappings to be loaded, relative to wiremock_mappings_path, like in this example:

```yaml
            default_mappings:
                - { service: service-name, mapping: mapping-file.json }
                - { service: service-name/and-subdirectory, mapping: another-mapping-file.json }
```

## Usage Example:
The WiremockContext provides a step definition to submit mappings to wiremock. Here's an example of a scenario using it:
```
Scenario:
    Given the following services exist:
        | service  | mapping         |
        | greeting | helloWorld.json |
    When I go to the "Hello World" page
    Then I should see "Hello World!"
```
The first step in the scenario POSTs the mapping information in the file %wiremock_mappings_path%/greeting/helloWorld.json to the Wiremock server.
